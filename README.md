# ti994a
TI-99/4A emulator for Linux

This is an emulator for the TI-99/4A home computer which was my first PC back in 1982.  I have been writing this emulator on and off for over 20 years.  It still has some outstanding issues but runs many games perfectly (munchman, ti invaders, etc).

To build, download and type make.  libraries etc have to be manually installed.

To run: ./ti994a inp

where inp is the input file that contains instructions to load roms/groms/etc.
